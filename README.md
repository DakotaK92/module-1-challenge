# Horiseon

When given the task with making a website you need a HTML and CSS.

Started with making two files with the copied HTML and CSS into a new folder called "Challenge-1". 

"Saved As" the files to "Challenge-1" folder on the Desktop, and also made a folder with all images into a folder.

Copied the Module-1-Challenge Repository into the Visual Studio Code and configed my user.name and user.email.

Inside the HTML, I changed the link to my CSS file in my folder. And pushed/commited everything to Github.

Also inside HTML, I updated the photos to all images in my folder, including the one inside the CSS. And pushed/commited everything to Github.
